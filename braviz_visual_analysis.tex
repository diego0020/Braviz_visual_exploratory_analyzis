\section{}
Brain researchers typically deal with large amounts of data from different sources and often, of different nature. This requires the use of several different software tools and makes it cumbersome and time consuming to answer simple questions. Because of this, data is not used to its fullest potential, and exploratory analysis is rarely done . This paper presents a software tool called BRAVIZ that integrates access to several data types and automates many of the cumbersome and error-prone tasks required to explore typical neuroscience data. This work focuses on integrating interactive visualization with real-time statistical analyses to facilitate exploration and discovery. BRAVIZ enables an inversion of the typical neuroscience analysis process by emphasizing images as the main organizing objects in the process rather than relying in abstract numerical indicators. This encourages researchers to notice trends and relationships, which motivate additional analyses and generally gain a fuller understanding of the phenomena represented by the data.  A case study is presented that incorporates MRI, DTI, and fMRI images together with a large amount of neuro-psychological and clinical data.  The case study demonstrates how BRAVIZ enables researchers to discover new hypotheses about the relationships between structure and functions of the brain.

\section{Introduction}

Traditionally neuroscience research has been dominated by confirmatory data analyses i.e. state some hypotheses, collect data and perform canned statistical tests in order to calculate an indicator of significance, such as a p-value. However, exploratory analysis \citep{tukey_we_1980} is also important for the advancement of knowledge. It is in exploratory analysis that surprising facts about the data are discovered and new hypotheses are raised. While confirmatory analysis is a linear process, exploratory analyzes involves iterating trough the data several times while looking at the data from different points of view and trying different configurations. It is more efficient if it is accompanied by graphical representations of the data, as graphics can help us understand the bulk of the data while emphasizing unusual aspects \citep{wickham_practical_2008}.

Visualizing and exploring data from brain studies and understand the association of brain networks and structures with a specific function is a broad challenge. Such studies include a large variety of data acquired from, e.g., physical measurements or instrumentation, neuroimaging, cognitive or motor testing, demographical and clinical characteristics, and their meaningful association required different domain experts to work together . Such exploratory research requires integrated analysis and visualization tools that ought to provide efficient access to data. In line, exploratory analysis is iterative and goes through the data multiple times in different ways: the objective is actually to find trends, patterns and general insights into already acquired data for developing later hypotheses to be tested in a new experiment. This requires concomitant and interactive visualization of different kinds of data with their context and numerical link to original image in order to detect patterns and outliers, the latter being monitored as actual data or the result of methodological issues. However, in current analysis tools  , where most image viewers are designed for quality control or for producing high-level publishable pictures, only the support to different steps of a confirmatory analysis is provided, i.e. a careful linear process from hypothesis to specific data processing and statistical analysis. Thus, applying visual analytics framework to the broad, interdisciplinary (heterogeneous) and labor-intensive neuroscience datasets will allow a group of researchers to conduct exploratory analyses and extract more efficiently an integrated feedback regarding between-data associations and discovery, thus reducing the need and time for independent work for hypothesis formation and refinement.

Visual analytics\citep{cook_illuminating_2005} is a emerging field that attempts to put human experts and machines at the same level so that, working together, data can be better understood. This requires an efficient communication between the computer and the expert, which is accomplished through rich interactive visualizations, so that their strengths and weaknesses complement each other. Human creativity, intuition, and expertise can guide the analysis into unexpected areas. Applying the visual analytics framework to neuroscience will allow researchers to extract more information from their large, multi-source and labor-intensive datasets, and potentially lead to new discoveries.

This paper presents BRAVIZ, a software tool to facilitate visual exploration of brain data. It provides access to image data such as MRI, fMRI and DWI, as well as data processing results, like surface segmentations, fMRI statistical maps and tractographies. It also supports access to clinical data and integrates simple statistical tools. 
%In contrast to the conventional workflow that introduces visualization only at the end of the analysis, BRAVIZ positions interactive visualization at the core of exploratory research. 
Simple, efficient and intuitive access to visualization facilitates creation of analysis input, evaluation of analysis results, and inspiration of new research hypotheses. 
%A main objective of the project is fostering collaboration between experts, especially inside teams including multiple specialties.

\section{Related Work}

In recent years the amount of MRI-Data collected has grown significantly. It is also increasingly common to find large medical image databases open for analysis, such as the human connectome project\citep{rosen_human_2010} and ADNI\citep{jack_alzheimers_2008}. This has created a need for exploration tools that will allow researchers from around the world to extract knowledge from this data. 

The neuroscience software ecosystem is rich with high quality tools. However most of them are designed for data processing and most of them are thought of as components inside the confirmatory analysis pipeline. These tools provide powerful transformation of the data that could benefit exploratory analyzes, nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, there are not many tools designed explicitly for exploratory analysis available.

For example, experts in neuroimaging typically use Freesurfer  \citep{fischl_freesurfer_2012}, fsl\citep{jenkinson_fsl_2012} and spm \citep{friston_statistical_2006} toolkits to analyze data. All of these sets include applications for interactive visualization. 3D slicer \citep{fedorov_3d_2012}, Brain Visa \citep{cointepas_brainvisa:_2001} and ITKSnap \citep{yushkevich_user-guided_2006} are other commonly used tool which provide advanced visualization and processing features. On the clinical side Osirix\citep{rosset_osirix:_2004} and proprietary software bundled with PACS and imaging equipment are very popular. 

In statistics, exploration tools like ggobi\citep{cook_interactive_2007}, aabel, SPSS, stata and Tableau\citep{hanrahan_tableau_2003} are used to analyze and explore data. Using these tools it is possible to transform data, fit models, and visualize relationships.  Interactive visualizations let the user explore complex relationships in the data, detect outliers and interesting subgroups, and grasp subtle patterns and trends. These tools implement techniques such as brushing, zooming and point identification. Insights discovered in this way can be used to develop hypotheses and tested in further experiments. 

A typical neuroscience research group, uses tools from neuroscience domain together with tools from the statistics domain. However moving data from one side to the other  is not trivial. While most statistical tools implement interactions that allow the user to iterate very efficiently through the data, the process for creating visualizations in the neuroimage side requires significant work; and is often focused on a single subject. Most of these tools were designed for classical hypothesis testing or case studies, and are very good for this purpose. 

As mentioned earlier, exploratory analysis requires a different take on the problem. Because quick iteration through the data is a main aspect, the friction of each iteration must be reduced as much as possible. The link between neuroimage based data and clinical data must be immediate and transparent. The objective is to get a broad and complete vision of the population and each subject, so all data needs to be easily available and integrated in the same platform. Notice that in order to accomplish this complete picture it is also necessary to look at the problem from different specialties.

INVIZIAN\citep{bowman_query-based_2011,bowman_feature-similarity_2012,bowman_visual_2012} is an application for exploring large brain datasets which integrates structural and scalar data. It organizes data in an abstract 3D space in such a way that similar brains are located close to one another. It is integrated with gGobi\citep{cook_interactive_2007} in order to explore relations between scalar values and more complex brain features. It can handle datasets of several hundreds of brains from different studies, and it uses sophisticated data mining algorithms, feature extraction and abstract spaces to create the visual representation. This tools can effectively be used to find patterns relating surface descriptors with clinical data and therefore relating structure with function of the brain. While it is indeed a great tool for exploring brain surfaces, it is still limited in the type of data it can handle and the type of visualizations that are available. It is primarily focused on the extraction of surface features and in applying machine learning techniques to brain data. In visual analytics term, INVIZIAN focuses on "Automated Data Analysis", while BRAVIZ focuses on "Visual Data Exploration" (see \citep{keim_mastering_????}).

The Visual Analytics of Brain Networks\citep{li_visual_2012} (VABN) software is focused on analyzing large connectivity datasets by defining a robust and repeatable algorithm for region of interest (ROI) placement that will act as nodes. This creates comparable networks that can be analyzed with graph based methods. The tool provides access to the underlying DWI or fMRI data in order to initially place the ROIs and to verify the results. The methods and software libraries used in this tool are very similar to BRAVIZ. However the objectives of both projects are different, as VABN does not seek to integrate connectivity data with other kinds of data. In the future BRAVIZ could benefit from VABN methods for network generation and robust ROI placement. 

Tools from the neuroimage domain are targeted to experts in that area, and therefore are not easy to use for experts from other specialties. There is still a large gap between neuroimage tools and statistical tools, specially for exploratory analysis. Inside the neuroimage domain, integrating data from different modalities is still cumbersome and requires significant skill. BRAVIZ attempts to bring clinical data and tools from the statistical exploratory analysis domain closer to the neuroimage domain, across multiple modalities, and in such a way that they are accessible to brain experts from different specialties. 

\section{Proposed Environment}

BRAVIZ was designed following a "user centered" approach\citep{fernandez_user-centered_2013,wassink_applying_2009}. The authors worked closely with brain researchers of several specialties, visited several labs and hospitals, and learned as much as possible about typical neuroscience research workflows and the bottlenecks they contain. 

The design, development and evaluation process consisted of several iterative cycles, prototypes were shared with domain experts, and their feedback motivated design ideas and usability enhancements for the next generation. As the development cycles progressed, the domain experts ventured further away from common paradigms; they were encouraged to dream, and not to worry about how complex it would be to implement the ideas. 

The initial stages of design focused on identifying the obstacles that affected communication between experts, and looked explored ways of mitigating them. The team of experts was composed of radiologists, psychiatrists, pediatricians, physicians, physiologists, statisticians, engineers and economists. Each of these groups of experts typically utilizes tools designed to foster their analysis and contribution to the team, but very few develop skills in tools outside of their areas of expertise.

An extensive literature review in the domain led to better understanding of the kinds of data patterns neuroscience researchers find interesting. In addition, the graphics and pictures in these publications were used as models for BRAVIZ visualizations so that they would look familiar to the neuroscience research community. From analyzing the visualization capabilities in common neuro-image tools, as well as the way experts use them, the BRAVIZ team learned what was expected from image viewers, which features were important and which ones were seldom used. This effort also exposed typical process bottlenecks that affect efficient exploratory analyzes.

The goal of BRAVIZ is to provide a tool that integrates the best statistical and neuro-image domains, and better supports exploratory analyzes with spatial data. A crucial aspect is providing a direct bridge between statistics and neuroimage visualizations. By integrating concepts from both domains BRAVIZ seeks to grasp the attention of all kinds of specialties and increase communication between them.  By decreasing data access overhead, it accelerates exploratory research and gives experts access to data that is typically out of their area of expertise.

Instead of one large application with numerous features and controls, BRAVIZ is divided into several small tools. Individual tools are tailored towards specific tasks and therefore are easier to learn and use. This tools are designed to analyze cohort data, i.e., data that is composed from a set of subjects with several measures. Smaller samples of subjects, or subsamples, can also be analyzed and compared against each other. 
%Nominal or numerical measures of the subjects are called variables, and these complement the neuro-image based spatial data. Note that the set of variables can be extended by deriving new values from spatial data or existing variables. 

BRAVIZ tools combine numerical and nominal variables with spatial data. There are tools to look at spatial data from a single subject with high detail, as well as tools to look at spatial data associated with a subsample; both with numerical and categorical data as context and tools focused on exploring these variables, but always linking back to details of each subject. Scalar data extracted from images is stored and managed in the same way as other clinical variables. It is also possible to extract additional features on the fly and add them to this pool of variables.

Each of the tools has data visualization as its centerpiece. This visualization can be customized, usually by adding or removing variables or spatial data, according to the question at hand. The state of the visualization can be saved  to recall it at a future time or to share it with colleagues. 
This visualizations are interactive and capable of generating a dialogue with the user.
As Colin Ware \citep{ware_information_2004} said "The best visualizations are not static images to be printed in books, but fluid, dynamic artefacts that respond to the need for different views or for more detailed information".  

Though the system is built from several small applications, they are designed to work together synchronously in order to support more complex tasks. Subsamples, variables and subjects of interest can be shared across tools and among colleagues. Altogether, this creates a flexible environment that can be adapted to several kinds of data, questions, workflows and experts.

Even though BRAVIZ has a very simple interface, designed to be easy to use, it was of vital importance to have the underlying mathematics and data processing operations done right. The data that is shown to the expert must always be exact, and all underlying transformations and calculations should be done rigorously. 

%Include also here the not repeated paragraphs from the Methodology (really motivation) section of the last draft.
Several of the calculations are made ahead of time and kept in a cache in order to speed-up response at analysis time. 
To maintain interactivity and provide high quality visualizations and data processing tools, BRAVIZ leverages several state state-of-the-art open-source applications and libraries, for details about the implementation see the supporting material of this paper.  
These features, combined with having all data and analysis tools a couple of clicks away; provides a pleasant and efficient exploratory analysis environment. 


\subsection{BRAVIZ Tools}

%Not sure if this needs a different section, maybe it should be summarized into the description

The current set of applications comprising BRAVIZ can be divided in three categories. One set of applications focuses on displaying geometric data using other variables as context, another focuses on manual measuring or creating new descriptors from geometric data, ant the last one focuses on exploring numerical and categorical data while maintaining a link to the underlying geometric data. Additionally there are tools for importing and exporting data in spreadsheet format; so that the tools can interact with statistical software. All tools are accessible from a graphical menu as shown in figure \ref{fig_menu}. The tools included in the current version are

\begin{itemize}
\item Create and Measure: Define new scalars of geometric structures based on spatial data for the whole cohort.
\begin{itemize}
\item Roi Builder: Create spherical regions of interest, using images or surfaces as context.
\item Linear Measure: Measure elements of any image using lines
\item Logic Bundles: Define fiber bundles by doing logical operations on ROIs and segmented structures.
\end{itemize}
\item Visualize Spatial Data: Explore different kinds of spatial data in context.
\begin{itemize}
\item Subject Overview: Visualize several spatial objects, as well as context information for a single subject.
\item Sample Overview: Repeat the same visualization for a group of subjects, sorted by a numerical variable and divided in groups by a nominal variable.
\item Explore fMRI: Visualize BOLD timelines, experiment design and contrasts (read from spm file).
\item Check Registration: Visualize two images at the same time to evaluate the quality of registration. 
\end{itemize}
\item Analysis: Analyze data from tables together with variables derived from spatial data. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Anova : Perform ANOVA analyzes on the database variables,
\item Linear Model: Fit a Linear model to variables in the database.
\item Correlations: Explore correlations between variables in the database.
\item Parallel Coordinates: Visualize multiple variables in interactive parallel coordinates.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize} 

The main interface of the Subject Viewer application is shown on figure \ref{fig_subject}. This tool provides access to MRI Images, Freesurfer semgentations and reconstruction, tractographies, tracula bundles and fMRI maps; all through graphical menus. The user never needs to know which files are involved in displaying a particular scene. Some geometrical features, as volume or mean FA inside a structure, can be captured directly from  this application and added into the database as a new variable. 

Below the main view (as shown in Figure \ref{fig_subject}) is a context panel, that displays the values of selected variables for the current subject. To change the current subject the user may use the controls underneath the main view, or select from the table in the subjects panel at the left. All of the current selected variables and geometric objects in the view are updated to display the information for the new subject. Thus it is straightforward to look at a certain aspect across different subjects. In the lower left corner is a control that allows the user to select between native MRI coordinate systems, Talairach space or Dartel template space (involves non linear registration). All of the geometric objects in the scene are shown in the selected coordinate space. The Talairach and Dartel spaces make it easy to compare among different subjects but may add some distortion to the objects, so the user must pick the most appropriate coordinates for the task at hand. 

A small-multiples view[19] display of several subjects, as shown in figure \ref{fig_sample}, is available in the sample overview application. This application is useful for finding trends across a sample or doing quality control and spotting problematic images. Subjects are arranged from left to right according to a numerical variable, and rows are defined by a nominal variable. In the example shown the two rows are males and females, and the ordering variable is the score in a math test. The bar-plot at the right shows the distribution of the variable among the two groups and is coordinated with the 3d views.A bar-plot is used because it provides the best sense of magnitude differences for variables that have a meaningful zero. Each view shows a collection of objects defined in the subject overview application. In this way the interface is kept simple, as there is no need for visual configuration options.

As before different coordinates systems can be used to make comparisons easier. The camera between the small multiples is also coordinated, if the view is changed in any of the views, the others are changed accordingly. In addition if the user is interested in getting a more detailed view of any of them, he can right click and from the context menu open a full subject viewer application with the correct scenario and subject loaded, or make all opened BRAVIZ applications switch to the corresponding subject.

At the core of BRAVIZ is a database that contains clinical and demographic data, as well as results from neuropsychological tests or questionnaires; and enriched with geometric indicators generated in external tools or inside BRAVIZ. All of the individual tools that BRAVIZ provides are integrated with the database. BRAVIZ provides several common statistical analysis tools that access this database, as for example, an ANOVA  analysis, which can be completed with the application shown in figure \ref{fig_anova}. In order to perform the analysis the user must select an outcome variable, one or more regressors and optionally interaction terms. It is also possible to limit the analysis to a specific subset of subjects. Afterwards it is only necessary to click on the Calculate Anova button, which fetchs the required data from the database and performs the calculation\footnote{Maybe there is no need to mention R here}. The main plot will initially show diagnostics, i.e. distribution of residuals and a scatter plot of residuals vs fitted values. The table at the bottom right shows the resulting fitted values. By double clicking on any row a plot showing the effect of that particular term will be displayed. From this plot it is possible to right click on an outlier to get additional information, or to show him on any other opened BRAVIZ applications. This plot will also respond to messages from other applications and highlight the corresponding subject.

It is worth noting that no correction for multiple comparisons is applied in the statistical tests; so care must be taken when interpreting the results. The objective here is not to prove hypotheses but to explore data and find interesting hypotheses, which should be tested using the usual methods.

Figure \ref{fig_other_apps} shows several other applications currently built into the system. More information as well as the source code for the project can be found at http://diego0020.github.io/braviz



\section{Case Studies}

In this research, a particularly representative case study, the kmc project \cite{schneider_cerebral_2012}, is introduced to both motivate the requirements for BRAVIZ and demonstrate its effectiveness. The kmc study explores the effect of treatment options on premature births and data on subjects was collected from several fronts. The original randomized study involving about 750 preterm babies was conducted in 1994 \citep{charpak_kangaroo_1997}. These kids were followed during their first year \citep{charpak_randomized_2001, tessier_kangaroo_2009} of life and several clinical and socio-economical variables were registered. Forty of the kids from the original study were re located at fifteen years of age, the  subjects went through several neuro-psychological tests, measuring attention, memory, reasoning skills and hand-eye coordination among others. They also went to vision, hearing and full medical examinations. Finally, they were scanned with Structural MRI, DTI and several fMRI protocols. \footnote{agregar este protocolo} These images were processed using freesurfer \citep{fischl_freesurfer_2012}, fsl\citep{jenkinson_fsl_2012}, camino\citep{cook_camino:_2006}, and spm\citep{friston_statistical_2006}; which extracted several numerical measurements and geometric structures as segmentations and tractographies. All of this data was collected for testing specific hypotheses but the specialists involved in the study are also interested in analyzing it for unexpected relationships and trends; in other words, to perform an exploratory analysis\citep{tukey_we_1980}.

\section{Discussion}

Several users who have contributed to the development of BRAVIZ now use it regularly as part of their work. They continue experimenting with the tool and proposing improvements. Many users, especially those without expertise in image processing, like how they now can create and analyze spatial data on their own.  By using BRAVIZ it is straightforward to explore the data and answer questions. It is also common for more complex ideas to occur to the user while exploring. While exploring in this fashion, experts often discover new ways to use the processing power of tools like Freesurfer or SPM; and therefore take better advantage of them.

Even without looking at spatial data, users enjoy getting visualizations of nominal and numerical variables instantaneously, which allows them to explore the dataset efficiently. BRAVIZ tools have proven to be easy to learn. It is designed to provide a starting point for facilitating exploratory analysis, and we expect that afterward users may move to more powerful and complex tools.

The features that BRAVIZ users appreciated the most were quick identification of outliers and being able to find nominal and numerical data together with the corresponding image data. An unexpected result was that by exploring the data with BRAVIZ several data problems were discovered and many of them could be fixed by going back to the raw data or processing again. 

The examples shown here used a rather small database, but BRAVIZ has been used successfully in a similar study with around 400 subjects. At this scale most of the visualizations still work, but for larger datasets new approaches must be developed. 

Some researchers are used to working only in confirmatory analyses, and are very cautious about exploring data freely. Sometimes they fear that exploration might invalidate any chance of publishing results. However as long as care is taken on interpreting the results of exploration and hypotheses are tested on independent datasets there is no danger in doing exploratory analyses. It is well known that the amount of data available for analysis today is enormous, but better tools are needed to navigate and explore it. There is also an opportunity to change workflows to adjust to this new reality and take the best advantage of the available data. Data mining tools and visual exploration of data has been successfully applied in several other areas, such as business and law enforcement, and will continue to gain popularity in brain research. 

Collaboration between experts is improved by having visualizations available to explain ideas. By having several applications open, large display real-estate can be leveraged (see Figure \ref{fig_imagine}). This works best when several experts are looking from different perspectives, and in this way unexpected elements and multidimensional trends can be spotted.

%Future work
%Web based?

In its current state BRAVIZ runs on the user's machine, and the installation process is not trivial. In the future it should transform into a webservice, running no a cloud environment, and available through a standard web-browser. However, the technology for displaying interactive 3D images on a web environment is not mature enough. Nevertheless, technologies as Brainbrowser\citep{sherif_brainbrowser:_2014}, and paraview\citep{ahrens_36_2005} are advancing fast, and probably in the near future it will be able to migrate to such a platform.

\section*{Implementation (Appendix)}

BRAVIZ os implemented in Python which is now popular in the neuroscience community \citep{gorgolewski_nipype:_2011, garyfallidis_dipy_2014}.  Powerful plotting, rendering, and data manipulation libraries are available, and because it is an interpreted language it can be used interactively and debugging is simpler. The trade-off is a loss of performance compared to compiled languages, but so far interactivity has been maintained by letting VTK\citep{schroeder_vtk_1998} and Numpy\citep{van_der_walt_numpy_2011} do the most expensive operations. It has been tested in Mac, Windows and Linux.

Mechanisms to read and display several kinds of spatial data are implemented, including images, freesurfer \citep{fischl_freesurfer_2012} cortex reconstructions and tractographies. This information is integrated with variables which can be stored as numerical values or labels. These can be derived from geometric objects by, for example, averaging FA over a region, by measuring the volume of a segmented structure, defining new fiber bundles and measuring their mean FA or by measuring the length of a given structure. These variables can then be used in the same way as the original context variables.

BRAVIZ is also a library that can be used for creating custom visualizations to support specific tasks. Figure \ref{fig_arch} shows the general architecture.

The "Read and Filter" module handles all access to the file system or network. Each BRAVIZ project is composed of a SQLite database, and the images and other geometric data. Specific project reader modules can be created to adjust to the layout, file names and other peculiarities of each project. The active project, favorite variables and favorite subject, are specified through a configuration file. This module provides other useful functions like attaching scalars to geometric objects, filtering fiber bundles and transforming between coordinate systems. Underneath it relies heavily on nibabel\citep{gorgolewski_nipype:_2011}, numpy\citep{van_der_walt_numpy_2011} , scipy\citep{jones_scipy:_2001,oliphant_python_2007} and VTK\citep{schroeder_vtk_1998} . Notice that this module handles all the necessary transformations of spatial data, and exposes a high level interface to the upper layers. In this way application designers can focus on visualization and interaction as required by end users and let the library handle registration and other low level operations. Accessing data through this module, allows developer to create applications that can be easily ported to different projects. 

The "Read and filter" module also provides access to numerical and categorical variables that are stored in a SQLite database. Pandas' DataFrames\citep{mckinney_data_2010} are the preferred way to manipulate data and move it through the different components of an application. This database also holds annotations, scenarios, and user defined geometrical objects. 

The "visualization" module provides reusable components for visualizing 3D geometric data and scalar data. VTK is used for all the 3D visualization while 2D visualization is achieved through matplotlib \citep{hunter_matplotlib:_2007} and seaborn\citep{michael_waskom_seaborn:_2014}.

The "interaction" modules contains, among others, several reusable user interface components, and functions for doing statistical calculations in R\citep{team_r:_2012} through the rpy2 \citep{gautier_rpy2:_2008} python package. The current version uses PyQt4 for the user interface with some web based visualizations built using the tornado\citep{server_source_2008} framework  This module also contains code to handle communication between different applications through the 0mq protocol\citep{hintjens_zeromq:_2013}.

At the bottom of the render panel some variables about the subject are shown to provide context. At the bottom-left corner we have controls to change the coordinate system, and to move the camera to preset positions. Most of the data is available via the different tabs at the left panel. The current tab provides a list of available subjects, it is enough to double click in a row to get the selected data for that subject. The arrows directly under the 3D viewer provide another convenient way to move through the subjects following the order of the list. }
